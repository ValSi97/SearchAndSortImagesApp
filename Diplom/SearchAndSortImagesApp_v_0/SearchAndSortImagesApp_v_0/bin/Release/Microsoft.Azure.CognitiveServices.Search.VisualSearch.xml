            The Image Visual Search API lets you send an image to Bing and get
            back a list of relevant tags. Each tag contains potential actions a
            user might be interested in. This section provides technical
            details about the request format and headers that you use to
            request actions and the JSON response objects that contain them.
            For examples that show how to make requests, see [Searching the Web
            for

            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior
            across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features and
            improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
            traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID
            for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user
            to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple
            conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight
            assignment than the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also,
            Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that client
            ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user.
            Bing also uses this header to help improve result rankings by
            analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance
            improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing
            APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this
            header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests
            for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API
            consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
            click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing
            APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have
            a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not include this
            header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should
            NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user
            uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API
            request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist
            the client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent
            HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not
            use a session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the
            device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the
            user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If
            the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it
            for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If
            you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in
            the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is
            used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the location
            information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional,
            you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
            X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for
            example, by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address
            results in the location not being anywhere near the device's actual
            location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the
            client's geographical location. Bing uses the location information
            to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local
            content. Specify the key/value pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;.
            The following are the keys that you use to specify the user's
            location. lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in
            degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and
            less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long
            (required): The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
            longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or
            equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
            positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
            radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the
            coordinates. Pass the value returned by the device's location
            service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell
            tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
            location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since
            January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or
            direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees
            from 0 through 360, counting clockwise relative to true north.
            Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The
            horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client
            device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that
            specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this
            key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
            optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate
            the location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the
            location is especially important if the client's IP address does
            not accurately reflect the user's physical location (for example,
            if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include
            this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you
            should include this header.
            </param>
            <param name='market'>
            The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the country where
            the user is making the request from. However, it could be a different
            country if the user is not located in a country where Bing delivers
            results. The market must be in the form &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country
            code&gt;. For example, en-US. The string is case insensitive. For a list of
            possible market values, see [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/supported-countries-markets).
            NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
            the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
            optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/supported-countries-markets),
            Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
            subject to change.
            </param>
            <param name='safeSearch'>
            Filter the image results in actions with type 'VisualSearch' for adult
            content. The following are the possible filter values. Off: May return
            images with adult content. Moderate: Do not return images with adult
            content. Strict: Do not return images with adult content. The default is
            Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy
            requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch
            value and uses Strict. If you use the site: filter in the knowledge
            request, there is the chance that the response may contain adult content
            regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only
            if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the
            possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate',
            'Strict'
            </param>
            <param name='setLang'>
            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using
            the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example, the language code for
            English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although optional, you should
            always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same
            language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings
            displayed in a different language. A user interface string is a string
            that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user interface
            strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com

            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior
            across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features and
            improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
            traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID
            for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user
            to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple
            conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight
            assignment than the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also,
            Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that client
            ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user.
            Bing also uses this header to help improve result rankings by
            analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance
            improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing
            APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this
            header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests
            for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API
            consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
            click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing
            APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have
            a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not include this
            header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should
            NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user
            uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API
            request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist
            the client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent
            HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not
            use a session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the
            device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the
            user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If
            the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it
            for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device.
            ATTENTION: You must ensure that this Client ID is not linkable to
            any authenticatable user account information. If you include the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is
            used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the location
            information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional,
            you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
            X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for
            example, by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address
            results in the location not being anywhere near the device's actual
            location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the
            client's geographical location. Bing uses the location information
            to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local
            content. Specify the key/value pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;.
            The following are the keys that you use to specify the user's
            location. lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in
            degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and
            less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long
            (required): The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
            longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or
            equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
            positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
            radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the
            coordinates. Pass the value returned by the device's location
            service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell
            tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
            location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since
            January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or
            direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees
            from 0 through 360, counting clockwise relative to true north.
            Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The
            horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client
            device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that
            specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this
            key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
            optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate
            the location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the
            location is especially important if the client's IP address does
            not accurately reflect the user's physical location (for example,
            if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include
            this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you
            should include this header.
            </param>
            <param name='market'>
            The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the
            country where the user is making the request from. However, it
            could be a different country if the user is not located in a
            country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
            &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country code&gt;. For example, en-US. The
            string is case insensitive. For a list of possible market values,
            see [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/supported-countries-markets).
            NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market.
            Specifying the market helps Bing route the request and return an
            appropriate and optimal response. If you specify a market that is
            not listed in [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/supported-countries-markets),
            Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that
            is subject to change.
            </param>
            <param name='safeSearch'>
            Filter the image results in actions with type 'VisualSearch' for
            adult content. The following are the possible filter values. Off:
            May return images with adult content. Moderate: Do not return
            images with adult content. Strict: Do not return images with adult
            content. The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a
            market that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to
            Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you
            use the site: filter in the knowledge request, there is the chance
            that the response may contain adult content regardless of what the
            safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are
            aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the
            possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off',
            'Moderate', 'Strict'
            </param>
            <param name='setLang'>
            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the
            language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example,
            the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English).
            Although optional, you should always specify the language.
            Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt
            unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a
            different language. A user interface string is a string that's used
            as a label in a user interface. There are few user interface
            strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
            properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
            </param>
            <param name='knowledgeRequest'>
            The form data is a JSON object that identifies the image using an
            insights token or URL to the image. The object may also include an
            optional crop area that identifies an area of interest in the
            image. The insights token and URL are mutually exclusive – do not
            specify both. You may specify knowledgeRequest form data and image
            form data in the same request only if knowledgeRequest form data
            specifies the cropArea field only (it must not include an insights
            token or URL).
            </param>
            <param name='image'>
            The form data is an image binary. The Content-Disposition header's
            name parameter must be set to "image". You must specify an image
            binary if you do not use knowledgeRequest form data to specify the
            image; you may not use both forms to specify an image. You may
            specify knowledgeRequest form data and image form data in the same
            request only if knowledgeRequest form data specifies the cropArea
            field only  (it must not include an insights token or URL).

            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing
            API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses
            the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you
            do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then
            Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to
            multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than
            the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client
            ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a

            include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
            on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
            makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
            in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
            mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
            next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
            response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
            subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the

            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies
            the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you

            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing
            API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses
            the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you
            do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then
            Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to
            multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than
            the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client
            ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a
            richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help improve
            result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The
            relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by
            Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header
            required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
            end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better
            quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application
            on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not
            include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in
            the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT
            include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
            on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
            makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
            in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
            mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
            next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
            response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
            subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. ATTENTION: You must
            ensure that this Client ID is not linkable to any authenticatable user
            account information. If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not
            include cookies in the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to
            discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to
            determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not
            obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
            Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
            device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous
            results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
            geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe
            search behavior and to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value
            pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;. The following are the keys that you use
            to specify the user's location. lat (required): The latitude of the
            client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal
            to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required):
            The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be
            greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
            values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
            longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the
            horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the
            device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m

            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing
            API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses
            the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you
            do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then
            Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to
            multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than
            the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client
            ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a
            richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help improve
            result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The
            relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by
            Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header
            required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
            end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better
            quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application
            on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not
            include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in
            the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT
            include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
            on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
            makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
            in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
            mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
            next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
            response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
            subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to
            discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to
            determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not
            obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
            Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
            device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous
            results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
            geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe
            search behavior and to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value
            pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;. The following are the keys that you use
            to specify the user's location. lat (required): The latitude of the
            client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal
            to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required):
            The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be
            greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
            values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
            longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the
            horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the
            device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m
            for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
            (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
            (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify
            the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
            relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
            (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
            client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies
            the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you
            specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more
            information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
            Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's
            geographical location. Providing the location is especially important if
            the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
            location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you
            should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a
            minimum, you should include this header.
            </param>
            <param name='market'>
            The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the country where
            the user is making the request from. However, it could be a different
            country if the user is not located in a country where Bing delivers
            results. The market must be in the form &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country
            code&gt;. For example, en-US. The string is case insensitive. For a list of
            possible market values, see [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/supported-countries-markets).
            NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
            the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
            optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/supported-countries-markets),
            Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
            subject to change.
            </param>
            <param name='safeSearch'>
            Filter the image results in actions with type 'VisualSearch' for adult
            content. The following are the possible filter values. Off: May return
            images with adult content. Moderate: Do not return images with adult
            content. Strict: Do not return images with adult content. The default is
            Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy
            requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch
            value and uses Strict. If you use the site: filter in the knowledge
            request, there is the chance that the response may contain adult content
            regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only
            if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the
            possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate',
            'Strict'

            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using
            the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example, the language code for
            English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although optional, you should
            always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same
            language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings
            displayed in a different language. A user interface string is a string
            that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user interface
            strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com

            the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client
            ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a
            richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help improve
            result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The
            relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by
            Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header
            required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
            end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better
            quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application
            on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not
            include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in
            the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT
            include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
            on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
            makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
            in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
            mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
            next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
            response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
            subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. ATTENTION: You must
            ensure that this Client ID is not linkable to any authenticatable user
            account information. If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not
            include cookies in the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to
            discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to
            determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not
            obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
            Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
            device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous
            results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
            geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe
            search behavior and to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value
            pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;. The following are the keys that you use
            to specify the user's location. lat (required): The latitude of the
            client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal
            to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required):
            The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be
            greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
            values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
            longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the
            horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the
            device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m
            for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
            (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
            (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify
            the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
            relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
            (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
            client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies
            the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you
            specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more
            information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
            Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's
            geographical location. Providing the location is especially important if
            the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
            location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you
            should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a
            minimum, you should include this header.
            </param>
            <param name='market'>
            The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the country where
            the user is making the request from. However, it could be a different
            country if the user is not located in a country where Bing delivers
            results. The market must be in the form &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country
            code&gt;. For example, en-US. The string is case insensitive. For a list of
            possible market values, see [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/supported-countries-markets).
            NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
            the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
            optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/supported-countries-markets),
            Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
            subject to change.
            </param>
            <param name='safeSearch'>
            Filter the image results in actions with type 'VisualSearch' for adult
            content. The following are the possible filter values. Off: May return
            images with adult content. Moderate: Do not return images with adult
            content. Strict: Do not return images with adult content. The default is
            Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy
            requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch
            value and uses Strict. If you use the site: filter in the knowledge
            request, there is the chance that the response may contain adult content
            regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only
            if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the
            possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate',
            'Strict'
            </param>
            <param name='setLang'>
            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using
            the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example, the language code for
            English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although optional, you should
            always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same
            language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings
            displayed in a different language. A user interface string is a string
            that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user interface
            strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
            properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
            </param>
            <param name='knowledgeRequest'>
            The form data is a JSON object that identifies the image using an insights
            token or URL to the image. The object may also include an optional crop
            area that identifies an area of interest in the image. The insights token
            and URL are mutually exclusive – do not specify both. You may specify
            knowledgeRequest form data and image form data in the same request only if
            knowledgeRequest form data specifies the cropArea field only (it must not
            include an insights token or URL).
            </param>
            <param name='image'>
            The form data is an image binary. The Content-Disposition header's name
            parameter must be set to "image". You must specify an image binary if you
            do not use knowledgeRequest form data to specify the image; you may not use
            both forms to specify an image. You may specify knowledgeRequest form data
            and image form data in the same request only if knowledgeRequest form data
            specifies the cropArea field only  (it must not include an insights token
            or URL).
            </param>
